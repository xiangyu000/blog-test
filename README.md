# Self Introduction


This is a piece of text trying to edit with markdown,There are two carriage returns before and after the paragraph



My hobbies will be shown in an unordered list:

* cycling

* swimming
* coding
* stand-alone games


The female stars I like will be written below in the form of an ordered list

1. 刘亦菲
2. 林志玲
3. 杨超越
4. 松岛枫

I will write a line of code in html5 and show it below

` <p>this is a paragraph,contains <strong>emphasized</strong> and <em>slanted</em> content</P>`

Below I will write a function in javascript language, which contains multiple lines of code

```
fuctiong sum(a,b){
    console.log(a+b);
}
```

This is a markdown file, I used to practice the method of writing articles in markdown

顺便回顾一下配置远程仓库的指令，git remote add origin加一个从仓库那里复制的地址，然后是git push -u origin master，把本地master分支推送到远程origin的master分支；

markdown还是挺顺手的，格式也比word简单
